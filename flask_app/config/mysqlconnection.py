#  mysqlconnections.py Lets me talk to the database !IMPORTANT!


# Next, create a new project called first_flask_mysql. In addition to the server.py file we make in each project, we'll now also need the following file. If you are having trouble with copying and pasting the code below, download the file here, or type it from scratch :)
